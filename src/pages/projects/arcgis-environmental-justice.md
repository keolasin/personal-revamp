## Summary

During our graduate coursework at UC Berkeley, our group developed a policy brief and interactive map through ArcGIS informing the public of an environmental justice issue affecting health in Navajo Nation.

## Background

### What is Environmental Justice?

Environmental Justice is the movement around environmental issues (such as global warming, toxic chemical leaks, contaminated air and water, etc.) that disproportionately affect marginalized groups and communities of color. With roots in the civil rights and environmentalism movements of the 1960's, environmental justice came into it's own in the 1980's with the United Church of Christ Report, "Toxic Wastes and Race in the US," coined then as "environmental racism". Today, environmental justice plays an important role in the intersectional environmentalism movements and in public health endeavors. 

### What's the connection to health?

Individual and community health can be affected based on our exposure to harmful agents in the environment: air pollution causes and exacerbates respiratory illness, contaminated water sources transmit disease, and extreme heat events lead to excess deaths. [The World Health Organization estimates 24% of all global deaths in a year](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789241565196) are linked to the environment. Unfortunately, many of these environmental issues negatively impacting health are unaddressed, under-funded, or lack awareness around them. Exposure to Uranium in Navajo Nation is one of those issues, and since it's an environmental issue that negatively impacts health in an already disadvantaged, minority community, that makes it an environmental justice issue.

## The Project: Navajo Nation and Uranium Exposure

To help raise awareness of the issue, an informational ArcGIS site was produced by our team to highlight the ongoing problem, health outcomes, and mitigation strategies.
