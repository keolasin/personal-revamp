As part of a public health communications course taught by Dr. Jessica Watterson at UC Berkeley, I completed an alpha video project focused on healthy eating as part of a public health communications challenge. After a preliminary research phase, including user interviews, synthesis, and capturing insights and themes, I created a brand identity that resonated with users while learning human-centered design principles and associated tools. I created the final alpha video using these insights to better reach the target audience.
